    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I went to Strasbourg in France, very close to Germany.
I visited the cathedral in the center of the city.
It was so amazing building - a large number of precise sculpture ouside, beautiful stained glasses in the hall.</p>

<p>There were Christmans market around the cathedral.
I did&#8217;t spend not so long there, but it was interesting to see many colorfull things.</p>

<p>Every restaurant in the center was full even after 14 o&#8217;clock, I moved to the restaurant between the main station and the cathedral.
I had stew of 3 kinds of meat which was simple and a bit salty.
But I enjoyed it because such stew, which may take a bit long time to cook, can not be seen in Germany.</p>

<p>It was so cold yesterday.</p>
